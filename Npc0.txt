Ah, hi. You don't seem from around here_My name is solaire from the distant realms of Astora._I arrived long ago in this forest with a group of companions._
To do a mission commissioned by the king, but everything got complicated for us_My companions died and only I remained, since then I keep looking for a way out_Let me give you information about this place so you don't make the same mistakes_
This forest is full of beings who want to take your soul away_the deeper you go the stronger the creatures will be_To be able to face them you should be well equipped but don't worry._
in the forest there are hidden some chests that will give you objects to help you_You will also surely find more people like me who can offer you some_ information will probably see each other again, I wish you luck on your trip_
