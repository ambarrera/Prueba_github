Ah, hi. You don't seem from around here._My name is Solaire from the distant realms of Astora._I arrived long ago in this forest with a group of companions_
to complete a mission commissioned by the king. But everything got complicated_for us. My companions died and only I remained, since then I keep looking for_a way out._
Let me give you information about this place so you don't make the same_mistakes.This forest is full of beings who want to take your soul away,_the deeper you go the stronger the creatures will be._
To be able to face them you should be well equipped but don't worry_there are hidden chests in the forest that will give you helpful objects._
You will also surely find more people like me who can offer you some_information. We will probably see each other again, I wish you luck_on your trip.
