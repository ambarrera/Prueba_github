20 years, I have worked for that thankful bad 20 years_
I dedicated my life to him so that one day he takes and kicks me out_
like a dog to try his luck in this forest, it is incredible, oh hello_

How long have you been standing there listening to me,well never mind Im Ghorm_ 
I was an advisor to King Lothric but I replaced the position and took over_
for no reason, wait, I know who you are_

You are the adventurer that is talked about a lot, let me help you_
I know you are looking for the king, to avoid expansion_
or to be able to leave the forest, look, I don't really care about them_

I only seek revenge on the fool I served for a long time_
So I'll tell you where he is, currently he is in his castle planning the way_
to expand the forest to conquer various kingdoms_

to get to his kingdom you just have to go straight until_
find a fountain and from there you can see the castle in the distance_
I wish you luck and finish him off_
