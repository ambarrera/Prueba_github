20 years, I have worked for that thankful bad 20 years_I dedicated my life to him so that one day he takes and kicks me out_like a dog to try his luck in this forest, it is incredible, oh hello_
How long have you been standing there listening to me? Well never mind Im Ghorm_I was an advisor to King Lothric but I replaced the position and took over_for no reason, wait, I know who you are_
You are the adventurer that is talked about a lot, let me help you_I know you are looking for the king, to avoid expansion_or to be able to leave the forest, look, I don't really care about them_
I only seek revenge on the fool I served for a long time_So I'll tell you where he is, currently he is in his castle planning the way_to expand the forest to conquer various kingdoms_
to get to his kingdom you just have to go straight until_find a fountain and from there you can see the castle in the distance_I wish you luck and finish him off._
