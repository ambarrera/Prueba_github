It's funny isn't it? Being trapped by the magic of the forest and after many_escape attempts I have lost my mind and the reasons to get out of here_You know a long time ago I was a famous buffoon always made laugh but one day_
in which the king was not in the mood, I made a joke that was offensive to him_I ordered them to execute me so I had to escape from the guards_and after a chase I ended up here totally lost_
at first I was desperate to get out of the forest_but when I couldn't do it, I decided that it is better to stay_the same if when it comes out it will be executed hehehe._
Ah? What is my name ?, mmm I do not remember well, I think it was_K - h- e- Khe, Uh Khelang my name is Khelang._now I dedicate my time to find the treasure that they say is at the end of this_
maze, I tried many times but I always go back to the same place_Where did I start, I think it became an obsession._If you want you can try to find the treasure to see if you can do it_
And so I can find something else to spend time on._
