It's funny isn't it? Being trapped by the magic of the forest and after many_
escape attempts I have lost my mind and the reasons to get out of here_
You know a long time ago I was a famous buffoon always made laugh but one day_

in which the king was not in the mood, I made a joke that was offensive to him_
I ordered them to execute me so I had to escape from the guards_
and after a chase I ended up here totally lost_

at first I was desperate to get out of the forest_
but when I couldn't do it, I decided that it is better to stay_
the same if when it comes out it will be executed hehehe._

Ah? What is my name ?, mmm I do not remember well, I think it was_
K - h- e- Khe, Uh Khelang my name is Khelang._
now I dedicate my time to find the treasure that they say is at the end of this_

maze, I tried many times but I always go back to the same place_
Where did I start, I think it became an obsession._
If you want you can try to find the treasure to see if you can do it_

And so I can find something else to spend time on._
