Privet, I am ZSIFF the big gray cat. Don't be fooled by my appearance_
I have eliminated several individuals over the years_
I've been here for some time, I'm saying it because you look like that_

a goat would have run over you several times XAXAXAXA_
well enough teasing, as I see it, our Destinations seem to cross_
Let me propose something to you,I arrived in this forest a month ago to try_

my bravery and my ability in combat since the rumor spread that in this forest_
extraordinary and very powerful creatures inhabited,I brought with me_
A chest with some objects that would serve me for the trip.

and a special object that passed through my family from generation to generation_
which is a ball of hair from Leviatan himself, but one day out of care._
A goblin stole it from me and hid it somewhere in the forest._

If you find it, you can keep all the objects except the ball._
I know you will find it, give it your best effort >:3._
