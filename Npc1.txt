Privet, I am ZSIFF the big gray cat. Don't be fooled by my appearance_I have eliminated several individuals over the years_I've been here for some time, I'm saying it because you look like that_
a goat would have run over you several times XAXAXAXA_well enough teasing, as I see it, our Destinations seem to cross_Let me propose something to you,I arrived in this forest a month ago to try_
my bravery and my ability in combat since the rumor spread that in this forest_extraordinary and very powerful creatures inhabited,I brought with me_A chest with some objects that would serve me for the trip_
and a special object that passed through my family from generation to generation_which is a ball of hair from Leviatan himself, but one day out of care._A goblin stole it from me and hid it somewhere in the forest._
If you find it, you can keep all the objects except the ball._I know you will find it, give it your best effort >:3._
