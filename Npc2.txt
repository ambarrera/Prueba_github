Oh An adventurer Hello adventurer, I am Burak, my family came to this forest_centuries ago and they liked this place so they decided to build a house that_step from generation to generation first belonged to my great-grandfather Biruk_
then to his son Barok. and so on until I get to me who am the last owner._But lately I've had a problem, look, the monsters or specters that_ive around here they were never a problem, but this week I am stalking a being_
that I had never seen before.Her behavior was very aggressive_which was not the case with the other beings that inhabit here._he steals my crops, the other day he destroyed a large part of my house, etc._
So it would be helpful if you could defeat him and finish_With the torment that I live daily, I trust you._
