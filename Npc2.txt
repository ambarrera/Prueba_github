Oh! An adventurer. Hello adventurer, I am Burak. My family came to this forest_centuries ago and they liked this place so they decided to build a house that_step from generation to generation. It first belonged to my great-grandfather_
Biruk, then to his son Barok and so on until it get to me, the last owner._But lately I've had a problem, look, the monsters or specters that_I've seen around here they were never a problem, but this week I am_
stalking a being that I had never seen before. His behavior was very aggressive_which was not the case with the other beings that inhabit here._He steals my crops, the other day he destroyed a large part of my house, etc._
So it would be helpful if you could defeat him and finish him._With the torment that I live daily, I trust you._
